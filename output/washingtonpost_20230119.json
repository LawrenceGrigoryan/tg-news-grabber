        "text": "Analysis: Putin says Russia’s economy beat expectations. Did sanctions fail?\n\nAs the global glitterati schmoozes in Davos, Switzerland, there is one country whose absence is notable, if not a surprise. Russian officials are effectively persona non grata at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain town, while Ukrainian figures like first lady Olena Zelenska speak to packed houses.\n\nThe symbolism is clear. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine almost 11 months ago made President Vladimir Putin and his allies toxic to this global elite. Russia has been showered with sanctions and export controls that seek to cut them off from the global economy, using a kind of systematic might to hinder the Kremlin’s war efforts and punish Putin’s allies.\n\nBut in the real world, has it actually worked? Far away from the parties in Davos, Putin on Tuesday used new government data to paint a surprisingly rosy picture of Russia’s economy. \n\nRead the full analysis here."

Austin is hoping to break the deadlock in Berlin and persuade Germany to send tanks, according to a senior U.S. defense official.\n\nRead the full story here."

Bradleys and Strykers would significantly bolster their firepower and allow soldiers to move quickly around the battlefield.\n\nThe coming transfer could contain nearly 100 Strykers, one of these people said. It would mark the first time the Pentagon has supplied Ukraine with such vehicles.\n\nRead the full story here."
